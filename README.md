# COVID19-SIR-Model
This project was completed during Fall 2020. We investigated methods of modeling the spread of COVID-19. We were interested in:
  1. Modeling flow patterns of COVID-19 to see how the virus affects different demographic groups (project part 1)
  2. Discovering fair ways to allocate resources to minimize spread of COVID-19 (project part 2)
